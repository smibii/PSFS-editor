#^ Syntax;

# Every section startes;
# and ends with a '*';

# Between the two '*';
# you will enter the name;
# of the section;

# exmp;
*example:*

# It is important to add ':';
# after the name, to validate;
# the name;

# Now you can add values;

# There are multiple types;
# of values you can choose from;

# Here is an example section;
# with all value types;

# exmp;
*example:
		# Normal value string;
		# {value_name};
		# output: value_name;
		value;
		
		# Value array;
		# {valu_name1}->{value_name2};
		# output: ['value_name1', 'value_name2'];
		value1->value2;
		
		# Validator;
		# true;
		# output: true;
		true;
		#^ validator types;
		#? true/false/null/undefined/NaN;
		
		# In file reference;
		# ref:{section_name};
		# output: ...value_names;
		# ref:example2;
		#? Value is commented because;
		#? there is no second section;
		
		# File reference;
		# ref:@{file_name}:{value_name};
		# output: ...value_names;
		# ref:@example2:example2;
		#? Value is commented because;
		#? there is no second section;
		
		# Remove values;
		# -{value_name};
		# output: ;
		# Removes value from output;
		-value;
		#! HAS TO BE AT THE END;
		#! OF SECTION, IF USED;
*

# Full section output;
#^ example: [;
#^	  ['value1', 'value2'],;
#^		true;
#^ ];

#? The references are in a comment;
#? and we also declared that 'value';
#? should be removed with -value;
#? thats why they are not in the output;
